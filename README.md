# GoHangmanServer

Hi. This is the backend server to the [GoHangman client](https://github.com/Poolitzer/GoHangmanClient).

There is not much to say here, you need to have the executable. Then put the [htmlFiles](htmlFiles) folder next to it, and you need to rename the [config.json.example](config.json.example) to config.json (also next to the exectuable) and add your own values in there.

Generate the bot account token by using the OAuth flow from the [twitch docs](https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/authentication/getting-tokens-oauth). 

I export executables for windows and linux currently, if you need another OS which is supported by [Go](https://go.dev/), make an issue and I will include it.
